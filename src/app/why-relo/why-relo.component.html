        <h3>First, we get to know you</h3>
        <p>One of our relocation experts will do an initial assessment
          to get to know you and your needs. We’ll ask questions like
          where your job is located and what kind of commute you
          hope for, what sort of home you’re looking for, what your
          budget is, and more.</p>
          <h3>Pairing you with an agent.</h3>
          <p>Once we hone in on communities that fit your needs, we
            will select an agent that’s an expert in that area, as well as
            the right fit for you. Our team sets up the introduction with
            the agent, and we remain available as for additional support
            throughout the entire process.</p>
            <h3>Working with your agent.</h3>
            <p>Your agent is well-versed in the relocation process and
              understands what you’re going through. They’re there to be
              your advocate, support system, and guide while navigating
